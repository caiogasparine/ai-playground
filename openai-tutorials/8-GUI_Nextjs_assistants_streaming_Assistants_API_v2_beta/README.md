# #8 Next.js graphical user interface for OpenAI assistants with response streaming using the OpenAI Assistants API `v2` beta

## Short description

Next.js GUI for the personal math tutor and customer support chatbot with response streaming. Both assistants were built in previous tutorials (see [#2 Build a personal math tutor](https://github.com/rokbenko/ai-playground/tree/main/openai-tutorials/2-Build_personal_math_tutor) and [#4 Build a customer support chatbot](https://github.com/rokbenko/ai-playground/tree/main/openai-tutorials/4-Build_customer_support_chatbot)). The personal math tutor is using the Code Interpreter tool, while the customer support chatbot is using the File Search tool.

> [!NOTE]
> The code in this tutorial works with the [OpenAI Assistants API `v2` beta](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants).
